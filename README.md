## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

MedCentral is built around 10 core entities, each mapped to a dedicated SQL table and corresponding API layer:

1. **PATIENT** ‚Äì Global patient registry
2. **HOSPITAL** ‚Äì Individual hospital information
3. **STAFF** ‚Äì Medical and non-medical personnel
4. **MEDICINE** ‚Äì Drug stock with reorder and expiry management
5. **EQUIPMENT** ‚Äì Hospital devices and machinery with condition tracking
6. **APPOINTMENT** ‚Äì Scheduled visits between patient and staff
7. **CHECKIN** ‚Äì Onsite hospital visit representation
8. **CHECKIN-STAFF** ‚Äì Staff assignment per visit
9. **PRESCRIPTION** ‚Äì Medicines prescribed during visits
10. **SALES** ‚Äì Billing and prescription fulfillment

Each table includes fields for `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `status` (where applicable) to support auditability and soft-deletion.
